                The Manipuri Dance, also referred to as the Manipuri Raas Leela (Meitei: Jagoi Raas, Raas Jagoi[4][5][6]),
                 is a jagoi and is one of the eight major Indian classical dance forms, originating from the state of Manipur.[7] 
                 The dance form is imbued with the devotional
                 themes of Madhura Raas of Radha-Krishna and characterised by gentle eyes and soft peaceful body movements
